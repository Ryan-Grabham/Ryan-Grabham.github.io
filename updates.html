                                    <p>As promised, we are now able to announce that The Sheps will reopen on Tuesday
                                        4th May. (full opening times and our garden food menu can be found on our
                                        website)
                                        www.the-sheps.net<br><br>

                                        As long as Boris’s roadmap out of lockdown stays to plan, we will be able to
                                        welcome
                                        you indoors from Monday 17th May, with this in mind, please note that going
                                        indoors
                                        until this time, will only be possible to access the toilets.<br><br>

                                        We hope the British weather is kind and you can enjoy The Sheps new “Secret
                                        Garden”,
                                        a space we have reclaimed back from nature during lockdown.<br><br>

                                        If you wish to book a table for your group (up to 6 people) please give us a
                                        call on

                                        It has been a long time and I speak for all the team when I say “We cannot wait
                                        to
                                        see you all soon”. You lovely people make “The Sheps” what it is and without you
                                        here it’s been a very sad time indeed.<br><br>

                                        Here’s to the future and the return of “Good Food, Good Ale & Good
                                        Times”<br><br>

                                    <h5>30th NOVEMBER 2020</h5>

                                    <p>December is just around the corner and with all preparations in place, we were
                                        getting ready to open our doors again and welcome you all back to The Sheps next
                                        week for what is normally the busiest month of the year.<br><br>

                                        However, with TIER 2 restrictions being so tight within our industry and after
                                        giving the subject much agonizing thought over the past couple of days (as to
                                        not
                                        only how it will affect us but your experience of visiting) it is disheartening
                                        to
                                        let you all know that unfortunately the doors will be remaining closed until the
                                        16th December. After which we hope for a better outcome of the tiering system.<br><br>


                                        Please know that this was an exceedingly difficult decision to arrive at and it
                                        was
                                        not made lightly.<br>
                                        Our motto has always been “GOOD FOOD, GOOD ALES & GOOD TIMES”, with the current
                                        restrictions in place this would simply not be achievable, and we refuse to turn
                                        it
                                        into “DRINK LESS, EAT FAST & F**K OFF”.<br><br>

                                        In the hope that the outcome on the 16th December (review date of the tier
                                        allocation), things are better, we plan to open. Albeit with possible imposed
                                        restrictions we will strive to make your visit a happy one, full of... “GOOD
                                        FOOD,
                                        GOOD ALES & GOOD TIMES”.<br><br>

                                        We appreciate that this news will come as a disappointment to many of you and
                                        for
                                        that we can only apologize, but we feel this is the best decision at this point.<br><br>

                                        For those that have made bookings for within the first 2 weeks of December, we
                                        will
                                        contact you over the weekend to hopefully reschedule.<br><br>

                                        We will be taking bookings for the 16th December onwards for single households
                                        which
                                        if the restrictions are lowered, we can amend.<br><br>

                                        Our takeaway service will continue throughout, available on Friday and Saturdays
                                        from 5pm and on Sundays 12pm – 2pm.<br>
                                        We would like to say a big thankyou to those continuing to support our local
                                        pub, be

                                        simply by the messages of good will and encouragement. Its heartwarming,

                                        and it gives us hope for a brighter future.<br><br>

                                        Hello lovely people,<br>
                                        We just wanted to give you a quick update on the changes you can expect to see
                                        at<br><br>

                                        
                                        <p class="main-p">FACE COVERINGS</p>
                                        It is now only possible to enter The Shepherds Rest if you are wearing a
                                        suitable
                                        face covering.<br>
                                        A face mask must be worn and be covering both your mouth and nose until you are
                                        sat
                                        at a table.<br>
                                        Once seated your covering may be removed, however, it must be replaced before
                                        standing again. (this includes visiting the bathroom)<br>
                                        We understand that some people are exempt from wearing face coverings and we
                                        will
                                        ask for proof of exemption.

                                        You may, as customers meet in groups of no more than 6 people on the
                                        understanding
                                        that you do not mingle with other groups.<br><br>
                                        Please refrain from being a “Table Tart” and jumping from group to group/table
                                        to
                                        table.<br>
                                        The 2 household rule for inside the premises is no longer applicable, in
                                        essence,
                                        you can sit inside as a group of up to 6 from multiple households.

                                        <p class="main-p">NO STANDING ROOM</p>
                                        The Sitting whilst inside rule has now been extended to cover outside areas
                                        also.
                                        You may only remain on the premises if there is a table for you to sit at and
                                        you
                                        sit down after you have checked in at the bar.<br>
                                        Our restaurant will no longer have tables available for more than 6 people. If
                                        your
                                        group is larger than this, we can accommodate you over multiple tables (socially
                                        distanced).
